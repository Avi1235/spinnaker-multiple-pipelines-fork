# CONTRIBUTING <!-- omit in toc -->

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from
opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon on the top left corner of this document to get
to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you find a problem with this plugin, [search if an issue already
exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant
[issue
form](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-multiple-pipelines/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing
issues](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-multiple-pipelines/issues) to find
one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as
filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an
issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with changes to the plugin, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to [link PR to
  issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer
  edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, an Armory team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using
  [suggested
  changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through
  the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your
  branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
  [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git
  tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you
  resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Armory team thanks you :sparkles:.
